# Description of the Game.
I'm excited to share my latest project: a classic Hangman game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This game recreates the timeless word guessing challenge, complete with modern design and interactive features.

Game Description:
Objective:
The objective of the Hangman game is to guess the hidden word one letter at a time. Players aim to correctly identify the word before running out of chances, represented by the stages of the hangman.

Gameplay:

Start Screen: The game begins with a welcome screen where players can start a new game.
Hidden Word: A word is randomly selected from a predefined list and displayed as a series of blank spaces, one for each letter.
Guessing Letters: Players guess letters by clicking on the on-screen keyboard or typing on their physical keyboard.
Feedback:
Correct guesses fill in the corresponding blank spaces with the guessed letter.
Incorrect guesses result in a part of the hangman figure being drawn.
Winning and Losing:
The player wins if they guess all the letters in the word before the hangman figure is fully drawn.
The player loses if the hangman figure is fully drawn before the word is guessed.
Features:

User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive layout makes it easy for players to start guessing words.
Responsive Design: The game is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a smooth experience across different screen sizes.
Dynamic Word Bank: The game includes a varied list of words to guess, providing a unique challenge each time.
Interactive Elements: The on-screen keyboard offers a tactile and engaging way to select letters.
Visual Cues: The hangman drawing provides clear visual feedback for incorrect guesses, adding to the suspense and excitement.
Restart Option: Players can easily restart the game to play again.
